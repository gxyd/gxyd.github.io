I have tried to learn a number of things, from time to time just for fun. Be it my "enthusiasm" towards learning bash-scripting from time to time, database administration in 2nd year. I have found truth about myself on introspection.
</p>
<p><br>
The thing that brings out the best from within me is when i work on a paid project, (how so ever tough it may be initially) or involves something that i care about.
</p>
<p><br>
Lets take examples from my previous projects or presentation topics:
<ul>
	<li>
	Course on Marketing: in this we had a project on "Ayurvedic Products", i didn't liked the topic since of non-interest in these things, the "interest"/"non-interest" is not the only thing. Even if i have an interest in something but don't know where i am going to use these techniques or knowledge in short-comings tend to be a disaster for me.
	</li>
	<li>
	Presentation in Economics on Apple Inc.: This presentation went really good for me. The main thing here it gave me the opportunity to look a still closer at Steve Jobs. I believe i had done good work on this. Here i was not paid for it, but rather involved something that i cared about and enjoyed reading about, "Steve Jobs".
	</li>
	<li>Upcoming Academic project on SymPy: I am positive about its goodness the project will bring. Hoping to make a good stride.
	</li>
</ul>
