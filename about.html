    I am Gaurav Dhingra. A final year student of Integrated Masters of Science, Applied Mathematics at IIT Roorkee.
  </p>
  <p>
    My hobby is software development.

  <p>
    I currently (since 2013) have a HP Pavilion 15 Notebook PC with 8 GB of RAM, 240 GB SSD. Earlier I'd 500 GB hard disk with 4 GB RAM, but upgraded both of them at the same time. Currently I work on Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS, with ViM as my primary text editor. I currently have a Moto G2, the last series in Moto by Google, since that it is now with Lenovo (doesn't run 4G network), which I got from my brother when he upgraded to Moto G4. I don't like mobile devices.

    For me a dream setup would be having a desktop with really peripherals, no need for Graphics card since I don't play games and would save me money, running Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS. I'm not a fan of laptops but considering that they offer mobility, I would like to have something with a solid build (ex. thinkpad may be).

    I miss my yamaha keyboard which is still kept at my home.
