Hello, I'm Gaurav Dhingra a 3rd year undergraduate student at IIT Roorkee, my proposal on Group Theory with <i>SymPy</i> has been accepted as a part of Google Summer of Code.

First, a little bit about [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/), a *Computer Algebra System* (CAS) written entirely in Python. SymPy 1.0 was released about 2 months ago, *Sympy* has been created by hundreds of contributors starting from 2006.

I will be working on Group Theory over the summer, for the next 3 months, to implement Computational Group Theory (CGT) and Group Theory, which are parts of mathematics I particularly enjoy. You can view my project proposal [GSoC 2016 Application Gaurav Dhingra: Group Theory](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2016-Application-Gaurav-Dhingra:-Group-Theory). Until a few days ago I was pretty busy with my exams, but in the next few weeks I will go over working on the project. I will particularly focus on `Finite and Finitely Presented Groups`.

I hope that I'll be able to implement everything that I promised in it. Moving onto the ongoing community bonding. Since I am very well acquitted with the workflow of SymPy, I can get straight to few important things, which i will do in the next few days.

This includes things like:
* Setting up a blog with RSS feed i.e this blog in which I am supposed to add an RSS feed functionality.

* Talking to my mentors regarding the time, and place of chat on internet, we differ by almost 5hrs. Time wouldn't be an issue, since seeing from past, I haven't faced such difficulty as both me and my mentor work for almost the same time intervals. From the GSoC 2015 discussions, I remember that Ondrej tries to make sure everyone knows what time student-mentor meet, since of different time zones.

* In the past we have had discussion on my private gitter channel [Group Theory Implementation](https://gitter.im/gxyd/group_theory_implementation). *Would it be wise to continue code discussions there?*. Since no one can be added in the channel without my permission.

One thing that has been a hell of a lot annoying has been the GSoC mailing list, it's a lot distracting. I changed list settings to abridged daily updates because I was getting like 50 mails every day and that too about some really stupid and irrelevant things. But yeah like whatever.

*"LESS TALK, MORE CODE"* is the policy that I always tend to follow (not for blog!!). I will try my best to implement it in a strict way this summer. I have seen this policy working fine for me, mostly first I start writing question in a message box to my mentor, and then i think more about it myself and in the end I come up with a solution on my own, instead of asking.

I'm quite sure that I will write more than enough blog posts about my project during the summers. Since I enjoy writing and that too regarding things that occupy larger part of my day.

I'd like to thank all the people involved with contributions to <i>SymPy</i>. My special thanks to my mentor - [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) and my co-mentor - [Aaron Meurer](https://github.com/asmeurer) for all the suggestions while making my proposal, and showing faith and enthusiasm in my ability and my proposal.
