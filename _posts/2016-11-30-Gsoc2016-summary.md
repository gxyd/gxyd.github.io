Below is the summary:

[Gaurav Dhingra](https://github.com/gxyd) - [Computational Group Theory in SymPy](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/6593494743252992/)

This project aimed to implement free groups, finitely presented groups and various algorithms like [Coset Enumeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coset_enumeration) using Todd Coxeter method, Low index subgroup and Reidemeister schreier.
Computation of order, index and other properties of the finitely presented
groups is now present. The functionality is added in the combinatorics module
of SymPy. He laid the groundwork for further addition of other algorithms
and integrate it with the permutation groups.
