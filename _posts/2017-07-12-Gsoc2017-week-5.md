We started working on implementation of [parametric logarithmic derivative problem using Risch structure Theorem](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12885). First we implemented the function `basis_Q`, which seems like we wouldn't be needing no-more. While doing that it seemed like there was problem with the `.is_algebraic` property, as it was returning `(pi**3).is_algebraic` as True. This bug was fixed in the pull request [#12924](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12924).

Also a few improvements to the [integral module pull request #12925](https::/github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12925) was also merged.


I don't have much to say for now, until I complete the parametric logarithmic derivate PR.
