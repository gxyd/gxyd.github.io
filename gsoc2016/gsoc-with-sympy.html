					<p>My proposal on Group Theory with SymPy has been accepted.</p>
<p><br>
I have been accepted for GSoC2016 project with SymPy to work on Group Theory. First, a little bit about <a href="http://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a>, a computer algebra system written entirely in Python. SymPy 1.0 was released one month ago.

I will be working on Group Theory over the summer, for the next 3 months, to implement CGT and Group Theory, which are parts of mathematics I particularly enjoy. You can view my project proposal <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2016-Application-Gaurav-Dhingra:-Group-Theory">GSoC 2016 Application Gaurav Dhingra: Group Theory</a>. Until a few days ago I was pretty busy with my exams, but in the next few weeks i will go over working on the project. I will particularly focus on `Finite and Finitely Presented Groups`.
</p>

<p><br>
I hope that I'll be able to implement everything that I promised in it.
